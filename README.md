# Awesome Notes
A "master" list of note-taking applications to end the endless googling. Created mostly for myself but aggregated mostly for everyone else.

Disclaimer: These are only applications that work on a desktop, though many do have mobile versions. I also only looked for applications that can house notes. If it could edit a note but not house multiple notes (think notepad.exe or TextEdit), that's not what I was looking for.
